## Introduction

The Military Health System Data Repository (MDR) is a centralized data repository managed by the Defense Health Agency (DHA). It captures, validates, integrates, distributes, and archives health care data from the Department of Defense (DoD). This repository aims to provide useful functions to facilitate the analysis of MDR data.

For thorough medical research, it is preferable to use the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) data along with MDR. The DMDC provides useful input variables when controlling for factors, enhancing the robustness of the analysis.

**Disclaimer:** This is not official work for the DoD or the DHA. Although this code was created by team members working as contractors for the DoD, the code was developed independently and is intended for educational purposes only.

This repository includes both STATA and Python functions. STATA is typically a DoD-approved software, and the STATA folder contains README files that explain the reasoning for these functions and common MDR and DMDC practices.

## Installation

To use the functions in this repository, you can clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/techno-quant/MDR-Analysis-Functions.git
